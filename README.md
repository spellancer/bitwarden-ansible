# bitwarden-ansible

Unofficial Ansible playbooks for deploying on-premise installation from the source.
> Warning: You should use the preffered installation way: https://bitwarden.com/help/article/install-on-premise/. Use the manual installation way only if you understand what you are doing and why you need that.

Based the official instructions for the manual installation way:
https://bitwarden.com/help/article/install-on-premise-manual/

## Requirements

- `ansible-galaxy collection install community.general`
- install sqlcmd for DB configuration with SQL scripts (after every upgrade):
    - for macOS: https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2017/05/16/sql-server-command-line-tools-for-macos-released/
    - for Linux: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup-tools?view=sql-server-ver15#ubuntu
> Note: Also JetBrains DataGrip can be used instead of SQLCMD
- local: `pip install hvac`
- remote: `pip install docker docker-compose`
- Optional: Hashicorp Vault client


## Usage

### Prepare playbooks

Fork this repo for yourself to edit them as you wish.
You need to change and fill something, before proceeding to testing:

0. Install requirements
1. Prepare and pass secrets variable (as dictionary) - better from external secrets storage like Hashicorp Vault. Checkout deploy.yml for example
2. Edit the environments/*:
    - fill the hosts files
    - edit the group_vars files: provide required values for variables
3. Edit the main configuration file template - global.override.conf.j2 in roles/bitwarden/templates
4. Replace / edit the mssql config file template - mssql.override.env.j2 in roles/bitwarden/templates
5. Replace /edit the bitwarden-nginx container config file - default.conf.j2 in roles/bitwarden/templates
> Note: Provided default.conf 2 is not the original one provided in the source. It's edited to be used with front-facing load balancer, which terminates SSL. Please use the official one.
6. Edit the main role variables file: roles/bitwarden/vars/main.yml
7. Generate certificates as provided in the instruction: https://bitwarden.com/help/article/install-on-premise-manual/, and place them in files/{prod/stg}/identity.pfx and files/ca.crt files. Save the private keys somewhere safe.
8. Replace / edit the roles/bitwarden/files/docker-compose.yml - it's custom docker-compose with MSSQL container disabled (for external managed DB usage). Or consider removing the task in roles/bitwarden/main.yml:67.
9. Checkout the latest version number and edit the version variable in the main playbook - deploy.yml.


### Initial deploy

> Provide required environment via -i option

Steps:
1. Prepare and pass secrets variable (as dictionary) - better from external secrets storage like Hashicorp Vault
2. Run high-level playbook:
```
ansible-playbook -i environments/stage deploy.yml --extra-vars "vault_token=<token>"
```
> If you have problem Ansible client for macOS: `export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES; ansible-playbook -i environments/stage deploy.yml --extra-vars "vault_token=<token>"`
3. Clone bitwarden server repo: https://github.com/bitwarden/server, this will be required on the next step, to execute SQL scripts in server/util/Migrator/DbScripts directory via SQLCMD
4. Run the db_configuration.sh (or the db_config.yml playbook with ansible on localhost) script with args:
```
./db_configuration.sh -u <db_username> -p <db_password> -h <db_fqdn> -s <sql_migrator_db_scripts_path>
```
You need to execute this scripts for **your release version** after **every upgrade**.

> WARNING: Currently there is a problem then upgrading the DB with Migrator/DbScripts - the scripts doesn't finish successfuly and your DB can be broken! Currently discussing it with the Bitwarden Support.


### Redeploy without upgrade

Run the 1,2 steps from "Initial deploy" section.

### Upgrade installation

Official instructions: https://bitwarden.com/help/updating-on-premise

1. Create the database backup
2. Check the database backup
3. Update Bitwarden release version in deploy.yml version var
4. Run the same steps as for "Initial deploy". Note: you should checkout / clone the upgrade version repository for step 3.

## Known bugs & Problems

### macOS Ansible client problem
- macOS: fork security bug (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/32499):
> objc[12784]: +[__NSCFConstantString initialize] may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called.

Fix: `export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES`

### Upgrading problem with DB scripts

Currently there is a problem then upgrading the DB with Migrator/DbScripts - the scripts doesn't finish successfuly and your DB can be broken! Currently discussing it with the Bitwarden Support.

There is no fix or workaround here for now, better always backup your DB and not upgrade the installation without first testing the upgrade on non-production hosts.
